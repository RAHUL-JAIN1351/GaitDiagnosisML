This project tries to leverage the potential large amount of data collectable from wearable devices. Currently, machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and SVM with Platt Scaling) and LSTM RNN are expereimented with experimental data. 
For more details, please look into the data analysis folder and the presentation foler.
